## **Overview**
A custm dataloader class has been implemented. It has features to set the batch size and shuffle the dataset. It can also iterate through the data using loop. Also a custom dataset class has been implemented which extracts the data into a list of tuple elements, with data in tensor format.

## **Features**
- **Batch Size:** Select the batch size toextract from the dataset
- **Shuffle:** Shuffle dataset
- **Iterate:** __iter__ and __next__ magic function have been implemented to iterate through the dataset using loop
